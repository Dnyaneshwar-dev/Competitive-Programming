/*

The Chef has acquired a vicious bunch of snakes, and these snakes are ever hungry and end up eating each other. 
In particular, each snake i has a length Li, whose initial value is given to you. 
A snake can eat any other snake which is not longer than itself. 
That is, snake i can eat snake j (i ≠ j), if Li ≥ Lj. And when a snake eats another snake, its length increases by 1. That is, Li increases by 1. 
A snake can eat multiple other snakes.

The Chef doesn't care about snakes eating each other. All he wants is to have as many snakes as possible, which are at least some particular lengths long. 
You are given Q values: K1, K2, .., KQ. Treat each of them independently and output the answer for each. 
That is, for each Ki, assume that you start out from the beginning with all the snakes alive and the 
lengths as the initial values given in the input, and find out the maximum number of snakes you can get whose length is at least Ki.
